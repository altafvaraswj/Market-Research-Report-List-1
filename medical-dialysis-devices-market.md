<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Dialysis Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li><li>Hemodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical dialysis devices market primarily consists of two types: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis utilizes the patient's abdominal lining to filter waste, involving the infusion of a dialysis solution into the peritoneal cavity, allowing for home-based treatment. Hemodialysis, on the other hand, involves the use of an external machine to filter blood through a dialyzer, typically conducted in clinical settings. Both methods address kidney failure and vary in patient experience, convenience, and healthcare resource utilization.</p></p>
