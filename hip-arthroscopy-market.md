<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hip Arthroscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pincer Type</li><li>Cam Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hip arthroscopy market encompasses two main types of impingement: Pincer and Cam type. Pincer impingement occurs when excessive bone extends over the normal rim of the hip socket, limiting motion and causing pain. In contrast, Cam impingement involves an abnormal shape of the femoral head, leading to joint stress and potential cartilage damage during movement. Both types contribute to increasing demand for arthroscopic procedures, driven by rising awareness, advancements in surgical techniques, and a growing aging population experiencing hip issues.</p></p>
